            <p>Appleton Sturgis was born June 2, 1842, in Baltimore, Maryland. Immediate family includes father Captain Russell Sturgis, mother Margaret Sturgis (maiden name: Margaret Dawes Appleton), older brother Russell Sturgis, younger brother Edward Sturgis, and younger sister Kate Sturgis. The family’s home residence was located at 164 East 10th Street in Ward 17 District 9, New York, New York. Sturgis' father was involved in the family shipping company, Sturgis, Clearman and Co. The company was owned by Appleton Sturgis' uncle, William C. Sturgis, and George M. Clearman. During the Civil War, Sturgis served as a lieutenant aboard the Union transport steamer, 
                <title render="italic">Achilles</title>, in the Peninsular Campaign, which spanned across Virginia and Maryland. In December of 1862, Sturgis was assigned to work for the Ordinance Office at the Headquarter for the Department of the Gulf, New Orleans, Louisiana, serving there for six months. His initial duty was as a clerk for the Ordinance Office, but he was later promoted to Assistant Chief of Ordinance. Sturgis joined the 3rd division of the 19th Army Corps after his service for the Ordinance Office was complete and was injured in the battle of Fort Hudson. After the war, Sturgis married Emily Lamb Elliot and had four children: Elizabeth, Russell, Dawes, and Arthur. Sturgis died in August of 1900.</p>

                    <p>To Mother. Sturgis just returned from Norfolk, which was taken by Union forces. The 
                        <title render="italic">Achilles</title> was ordered up to Norfolk shortly after the city was taken, and was the second ship to arrive after the 
                        <title render="italic">Victory</title>. As the ship travelled up Sewells Point, they passed President Abraham Lincoln aboard the steamer 
                        <title render="italic">King Phillip</title>. The crew gave the president three cheers as they went by, and President Abraham Lincoln took off his hat and bowed. Sturgis describes the celebration when they arrived in the city, and the view of the guns on Canary Island. Upon passing the 
                        <title render="italic">Monitor</title> Sturgis found out from the crew that the 
                        <title render="italic">Merrimack</title> was sunk just below Canary Island. Sturgis describes what the crew of the 
                        <title render="italic">Monitor</title> said about the battle that occurred as well as the look and price of various food items after going ashore and the appearance of the city.</p>

Sturgis goes on to further discuss charter business and dates. The crew is getting homesick, and Sturgis does not think they will stay after their contract months are up.</p>

The crew is well and satisfied, and the cooks are clean and use up the stores efficiently. Sturgis thinks they will be staying until Richmond is taken and then ordered up the James River.

                    <p>To Mother. The office has been slow, and Sturgis writes that he has been bored. Sturgis thinks Port Hudson will likely fall within the week. General Banks has been crossing a force towards Bayou Lara, while General Anges will advance from Baton Rouge, and General Grant is within 50 miles of the city. Relays news that there are 1000 rebels at Port Hudson and the railroad line was cut from Clinton. Sturgis expresses concern that New Orleans has less than 5000 troops in the city, since most have been sent to battle.</p>
